**English** | [中文](./README.md)

## Introduce

The Lite version is based on [vue-pure-admin](https://github.com/pure-admin/vue-pure-admin), keeps the core features for real projects, and remains under `2.3MB` even with global [element-plus](https://element-plus.org). This repository is now streamlined for a local single-program workflow, with Tauri desktop runtime as the primary target.
